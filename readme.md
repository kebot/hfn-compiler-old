Usage 
=================
update 2013.12.10
-----------------
```
npm install ./
./node_modules/.bin/coffee js/index.coffee
```
modify some coffee in `example/js`, or sass in `example/css`

you can see it will compiled on the fly just harp.


it's a new front-end workflow
======================

Why I create hfn:

0. Replace Harp

1. Don't want write Gruntfile, Harp Plugin or something else anymore,
   just write nodejs and do what I want to do.

2. Not now
